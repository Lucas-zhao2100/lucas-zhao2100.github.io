About Me
========

**Hi there, I'm Chunyu Zhao 👋**<br>
I am currently a Master's student at the [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqiang Xiao](https://geot.bnu.edu.cn/Public/htm/news/5/172.html). I am a member of the [MUSES (MUltiscale Satellite remotE Sensing)](https://muses.bnu.edu.cn/) team. My research sits at the intersection of Remote Sensing, Deep Learning, and Geological Sciences. 

Before joining BNU, I obtained my B.E. in Resources Prospecting Engineering (Solid Mineral Resources) from [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) in 2019, where I graduated as an **Outstanding Graduate. My undergraduate thesis was completed under the guidance of [Prof. Gongwen Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gongwen-Wang). 

My reseaarch interets include:
------
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
2. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
3. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
4. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
5. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
6. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
